/*
TODO(brett19): Solve the race condition that exists in the timers.
There exists a race condition when it comes to time-travelling here.  Technically
time-travelling is expected by consumers to be a synchronous thing.  IE: If you set
a timer, and then time travel past its execution time, that it will have executed.
Unfortunately timers are executed asynchronously, so it's possible that they will
not have been invoked synchronously, for instance if they were triggered on the
very precipice of the time travel call, they might still be pending...
This has been worked around currently by waiting for 5ms after a time travel to
allow any pending timers to wake up and execute.
